# ANN_IVFFlat-Index
In this project we have focused on implementing and optimizing Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) IVF-Flat search algorithm for 70-dim vector data. ANN search is a fundamental operation in many modern applications, from recommendation systems to image retrieval, where exact nearest neighbor search becomes computationally prohibitive as data scales.
